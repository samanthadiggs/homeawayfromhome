# Home Away From Home

this was originally my AP CSP performance task for 2024, but i decided to expand on it and make it fully functional!

with this project, i am learning how to use Object Oriented Programming to make my code more efficient
for the backbone of the project, because i am new to pygame, i am following ClearCode's Pydew Valley tutorial found [here](https://youtube/com)
However, I have my own ideas which can be found in the game logic file which I will be adding once I finish the backbone/basic fucntionality of the game!
