# farmville
ap csp performance task 2024 :)

My Performance Task Project is called Farmville. It is inspired by StardewValley, Chef RPG, and Animal Crossing, however, most of the idea is entirely my own! The goal with Farmville is to start your little farm on an island of your choice! The goal is for it to be educational as well by explaining sustainability best practices!
