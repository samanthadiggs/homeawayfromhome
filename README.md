# Home Away From Home


With this project, I am learning how to use Object Oriented Programming to make my code more efficient
for the backbone of the project, because i am new to pygame, I am following ClearCode's Pydew Valley tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c)
However, I have my own ideas which can be found in the game logic file!
