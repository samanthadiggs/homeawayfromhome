# Home Away From Home

Whis was originally my AP CSP performance task for 2024, but I decided to expand on it and make it fully functional! (I frankly don't enough know if I am allowed to post this on my github...hopefully collegeboard doesn't find this)

With this project, I am learning how to use Object Oriented Programming to make my code more efficient
for the backbone of the project, because i am new to pygame, I am following ClearCode's Pydew Valley tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c)
However, I have my own ideas which can be found in the game logic file! The game_logic file is compeltely mine (i started it a few months ago solely for my AP CSP performance task before i even decided to expand it) which I will be adding once I finish the backbone/basic fucntionality of the game!
